## Instructions

This code exemplifies the Kotlin DSL for Prolog described in [this paper](http://woa2020.apice.unibo.it/wiki/papers/paper14/).

The DSL is implemented as part of the [tuProlog project](http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Tuprolog/WebHome?language=en).

You can run the example by executing the following command on a *nix shell:
```bash
./gradlew run
```
whereas on Windows you should write:
```
.\gradlew run
```
This will compile & launch the `Example.kt` class.

Feel free to edit it and play with our DSL.
Try to import this project into your favourite IDE and let its code-completion facility drive your coding.
